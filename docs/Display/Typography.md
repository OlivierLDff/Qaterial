# ðŸ“œ Typography

Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

Too many type sizes and styles at once can spoil any layout. A typographic scale has a limited set of type sizes that work well together along with the layout grid.

`Qaterial.Style.TextType` is here to make life easier when you want to use text in a layout.

```js
  enum TextType
  {
    Display3,
    Display2,
    Display1,
    Heading,
    Title,
    Subheading,
    ListText,
    ListSecText,
    Overline,
    Body2,
    Body1,
    Caption,
    Hint,
    Button,
    Menu,
    MenuHint
  } // TextType
```

Several Type of typography are available with this `enum` :
