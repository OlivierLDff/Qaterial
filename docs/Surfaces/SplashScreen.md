A **splash screen** is a [graphical control element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_control_element) consisting of a [window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)) containing an [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image), a logo, and the current version of the software. A splash screen usually appears while a game or program is launching. A **splash page** is an introduction page on a [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website). A splash screen may cover the entire [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_screen) or web page; or may simply be a rectangle near the center of the screen or page. The splash screens of [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems) and some applications that expect to be run in full screen usually cover the entire screen.

## SplashScreen

The `SplashScreen` component contain an `image`, a `text` and a `version` string. Loading is shown with a `ProgressBar`, and can be controlled with `from`, `to`, `value`, `indeterminate`. 

It is based on `Rectangle`.

```js
import Qaterial 1.0 as Qaterial

Qaterial.SplashScreen
{
  width: 480
  height: 270
  image: "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/11/14/20/50/hd-3816045_960_720.jpg"

  text: "Loading ..."
  version: Qaterial.Version.readable
}
```

## SplashScreenWindow

A `SplashScreenWindow` is a `Window` showing a `SplashScreen`. It has special flags to appear as a Splash Screen on most Os.

The `SplashScreenWindow`  turn visible as soon as the window finished to load.

## How to show SplashScreen then ApplicationWindow

The easiest way to show a SplashScreen then your main application is to use `Loader`.

```js
import QtQuick 2.0
import Qaterial 1.0 as Qaterial

Item
{
  Loader
  {
    id: splashScreenLoader
    active: false
    sourceComponent: Qaterial.SplashScreenWindow { }
     
    // Start to load application as soon as splash screen is visible
    Component.onCompleted: () => applicationLoader.active = true
  } // Loader

  Loader
  {
    id: applicationLoader
    active: false
    sourceComponent: Qaterial.ApplicationWindow
    {
      // Kill the splash screen when main window is visible
      Component.onCompleted: () => splashScreenLoader.active = false
    }
  } // Loader

  Component.onCompleted: (function())
  {
    // Setup the app ...
                          
    // Show splash screen
    splashScreenLoader.active = true
  }
}
```
