      This property defines the item that is going to be used as the mask.

      visibility in the display.

  property variant maskSource

  /*!
      This property defines a threshold value for the mask pixels. The mask
      pixels that have an alpha value below this property are used to
      completely mask away the corresponding pixels from the source item. The
      mask pixels that have a higher alpha value are used to alphablend the
      source item to the display.

      The value ranges from 0.0 (alpha value 0) to 1.0 (alpha value 255). By
      default, the property is set to \c 0.0.

  /*!
      This property defines the smoothness of the mask edges near the

      0.0 uses mask normally with the specified threshold. Setting higher
      spread values softens the transition from the transparent mask pixels
      towards opaque mask pixels by adding interpolated values between them.

      The value ranges from 0.0 (sharp mask edge) to 1.0 (smooth mask edge).
      By default, the property is set to \c 0.0.

      This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
      improve the rendering performance.

      Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in
      the cache must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an
      extra buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

      It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
      properties are animated.

      By default, the property is set to \c false.
