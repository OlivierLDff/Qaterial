        This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
        improve the rendering performance.

        Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in
        the cache must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an
        extra buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

        It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
        properties are animated.

        By default, the property is set to \c false.
